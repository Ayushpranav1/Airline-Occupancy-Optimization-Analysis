# Airline Occupancy Optimization Analysis Project

## Objective
The primary objective of this data analysis project is to utilize SQL to identify opportunities for increasing the occupancy rates on low-performing flights. By optimizing occupancy, I aim to enhance the airline's overall profitability.

## Business Problem
As a provider of high-quality air transportation services, the airline has consistently ensured a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for passengers. However, the industry is currently facing significant profitability challenges due to a variety of external pressures. These include stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased fuel prices, and a tight labor market that has driven up labor costs. To mitigate these challenges, I plan to conduct a thorough analysis of the airline's flight data to uncover opportunities to increase occupancy rates, thereby maximizing the average profit per seat.

## Key Obstacles
* Stricter Environmental Regulations: The airline industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, leading to the implementation of more stringent environmental laws. These regulations not only raise operating costs but also limit expansion potential.

* Higher Flight Taxes: Governments around the world are imposing heavier taxes on flights, both to address environmental concerns and to generate revenue. These increased taxes have raised the overall cost of flying, which in turn has dampened demand.

* Tight Labor Market: The aviation sector is currently experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, which has resulted in higher labor costs and increased turnover rates.

## Data Analysis Insights
* Initial Analysis: I conducted a basic analysis of the data, focusing on aircraft with more than 100 seats, trends in ticket bookings, and average fare conditions. Utilizing a line chart, I visualized ticket booking and revenue trends over time, revealing patterns that will inform strategies to optimize pricing and increase occupancy rates.

* Fare Condition Analysis: Through a bar graph comparison of fare conditions across different aircraft types, I discovered that business class fares consistently outpace economy class fares. This finding is critical for developing targeted pricing strategies.

* Revenue and Occupancy Metrics: I examined key metrics such as total revenue, average revenue per ticket, and occupancy rates for each aircraft. The analysis revealed that the SU9 aircraft, which offered the lowest fares in both business and economy classes, generated the highest total revenue. Conversely, the CN1 aircraft, which only offers economy class at lower prices, had the lowest revenue, potentially due to its limited amenities or less favorable conditions.

* Impact of Increasing Occupancy: To explore the potential benefits of higher occupancy rates, I simulated a 10% increase across all aircraft and analyzed the resulting revenue growth. The findings indicate that refining pricing strategies could lead to substantial improvements in profitability.

## Conclusion
In summary, this data analysis project underscores the importance of a data-driven approach to optimizing revenue and occupancy rates in the airline industry. By adjusting pricing strategies according to aircraft conditions and fare classes, airlines can significantly improve occupancy rates and overall profitability. Additionally, while increasing occupancy is a key lever for profitability, it must not compromise customer satisfaction or safety. By balancing these priorities, airlines can achieve sustainable success in a highly competitive environment.
